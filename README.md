This project, Leveraging Genetic Data for Lung Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning, focuses on predicting lung diseases like lung cancer, COPD, and pulmonary fibrosis through machine learning models trained on genetic and clinical data. 
Using techniques such as feature selection (PCA, RFE), dimensionality reduction, and models including Random Forest and CNNs, the project achieves high accuracy in early disease prediction. 
The goal is to support early diagnosis, improve patient outcomes, and contribute towards precision medicine while ensuring data privacy and model interpretability.
